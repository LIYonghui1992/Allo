  			Design a product you believe might appeal to a broad audience. This product should meet the following requirements:<br />
        - The product should appeal to a broad audience. A headset is fine, a fishing rod only aimed towards elder fishermen is not.<br />
        - The product should be able to be developed by you and within a time span of about 6 months. A mobile speaker is ok, a whole new mobile phone with dedicated OS is not. (except if you can develop it within that time span of course!)<br />
        - We can arrange some external help for the electronics etc, however this should be kept to a minimum.<br />
        - The product should be tangible, so no new protocol for electronic communication, but a physical product.<br />
        - The retail price of the product should be not more than of similar products on the market.<br />
        - The production of the product should be scalable. So no handicrafts like e.g. a hand-painted bracelet.

  			We then will publish it on our website, where people from all over the world will have the chance to support your project. Being published is the first	step to get your product onto the market.

  			Visitors can pre-order any products published. <br>
        When a product is funded, the fun part begins. We will set a launch date, and are confident that we will stick to it. <br>
        So far, all is pretty similar to other crowdfunding platforms. However from here onwards is how our DesignNest differs:<br>
        Getting funded is not even a hard requirement for your project to hit the shelves: even if you do not reach the set target there is still no need for despair: if we believe in your product we will chip in for the part still missing to reach the funding target. So also when you do not reach your funding goal there is still a chance to get your product onto the shelves! How awesome is that?!<br>

  			We also want this to be a great learning experience for you. This is why when your project is selected, we will invite you to our Shanghai office. No need to worry about the accommodation and flight, these will both be paid by us! You then will be able to join our design team and realise your project in close cooperation with us. This will be a unique learning experience, where you will be able to see your product come into life: from the first prototypes to the making of the tooling and production of the first batches.<br>

  			We have dedicated sale teams on three different continents, which are able to cater to distributors from within their own time zone. As a result we currently sell our products all over the world: from Brazil, to Germany, to Japan, and adding your product to that is fairly easy.<br>

  		<font>
  			Price-wise, we aim for the mass market, so we only take a small profit margin between us and the distributor. We prefer to earn 100 times 1 dollar rather than one time 100 dollars, as this means that your product is in 100 households. All profit made is equally divided between you and us.<br>
        You might also ask yourself what is in it for us? For us the most important is to expand our product portfolio: this makes it more likely for us to get onto the shelves of large retailers. Another important aspect is the manufacturing: as our portfolio widens we can further reduce our overhead costs and bargain lower prices from our suppliers.<br>

  			The intellectual property rights of the product will remain yours. Manufacturing and distribution wise we offer you a lot of flexibility:<br>
        We can manufacture the product at our facilities, or you can find your own company to manufacture and we only handle the distribution<br>
        You launch it on your own, and we only do the manufacturing. We do not do the distribution and do not include your product in our product portfolio.<br>
        When we do the distribution we will include it in our product portfolio and take it to all fairs relevant to your product that we will visit. <br>

  			How Allocacoc DesignNest differs from other crowdfunding platforms<br>
        Your design is more likely to make it because:<br>
        - We only publish projects we believe there is a market for<br>
        - The amount of funding will be lower than most other crowdfunding platforms, as it is set by us. Because we can use our contacts in the manufacturing industry we will be able to get better prices - resulting in your project to be much more likely to make it.<br>
        - It takes years to set up a distribution network from scratch. We have all contacts already and can be found at several of the largest retailers worldwide. <br>
